After making strenuous efforts to fulfil government stipulations, a lease was secured, and construction commenced in phases until the final completion in the early 1990s.

It was the unfailing support and hard work of committees, members, management and staff that enabled us to overcome all the challenges and become the thriving institution that we are today.

You'll work in teams of typically 3 - 5 consultants to identify, and oftentimes implement, potential solutions for a specific client problem or challenge. Together, you will help clients make lasting improvements to their performance and realize their most important goals.
Over the course of each project, you will gather and analyze information, formulate, and test hypotheses, and develop and communicate recommendations. You'll also present results to client management and implement recommendations in collaboration with client team members. In some cases, you will be asked to travel to your client site.
When you join McKinsey, you are joining a firm whose culture is distinctive and inclusive. We will accelerate your development as a leader to create positive, enduring change in the world. As a business analyst, you will receive training and coaching on how to better:
Structure ambiguous problems and take action to solve them

During your first few years with the firm, you will serve as a business analyst on multiple client engagements and work with a number of colleagues and clients in a range of industry and functional areas.  
We encourage you to explore different content areas or geographies through a year-long rotation with one of our practices (e.g., corporate finance, social sector, healthcare, operations) or global offices; many do this after two years as a generalist business analyst.  You will likely intersect with many elements of our firm’s work including digital, implementation, and tech and analytics capabilities – either by collaborating on teams or working with colleagues from these group.
Following your business analyst tenure, assuming good performance, you will move into a post-graduate school role.  Some business analysts will take advantage of the opportunity to get outside experience through a secondment (externship) with a private sector or social sector client with the firm’s support.  Others may choose to pursue graduate school with support from the firm.","Undergraduate degree or master’s degree or 1+ years of work experience after completing your undergraduate degree; Requirements may vary by country or practice

Under the BA curriculum we offer major and minor programmes in English Studies and Language and Communication. English Studies is the scholarly investigation of the English language and its many uses in social and historical contexts. It prominently includes the study of literature(s) written in English as well as creative writing. Both the language and the literatures are studied from multiple perspectives, linguistic ones and literary ones, and also including critical and cultural theory. Our English Studies programme has a strong cross-cultural orientation, recognizing English as a language of global communication and world literature, a language which people make their own, creatively and habitually, all over the world.  Language and Communication is an interdisciplinary programme that centres on the study of the use of language in society in a multilingual, globalized world, with a particular focus on languages of global import, such as English, as well as those with local significance, and how they are appropriated and positioned in the multilingual, cosmopolitan contexts of Asia. The programme provides the theoretical foundations and applied contexts for understanding and addressing linguistic and social questions of language and communication.
The School also contributes to the teaching of the BA&BEd in Language Education (English) and the BA&LLB double degree programmes.
Our teaching staff is broadly international and currently comprises eighteen academics who work in different areas of English literary studies and linguistics.
Our courses are designed to be interesting, challenging, and rigorous. Our emphasis is on critical and independent thinking, and we hope to prepare students to face a technologically advanced, globally competitive, and culturally open society. We incorporate a variety of teaching and learning methods, including formal lectures, seminars, small group tutorials, workshops, and online learning.
We provide supervision for research postgraduate degrees (M.Phil. and Ph.D.) and also offer two taught postgraduate programmes, a Master of Arts in English Studies and a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing in English.","Please address your application to : Professor Olga Zayts, Director of HKU Research and Impact Initiative on Communication in Healthcare","School of English, Room 735, 7/F, Run Run Shaw Tower, Centennial Campus, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong",anguscsm@hku.hk,,,https://jobs.hku.hk/cw/en/job/528647/research-assistant-iii-several-posts-in-the-school-of-english,"How to Apply

there until 1968. Cristóbal Balenciaga had a reputation as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as ""the master of us all"" by Christian Dior and as “The Couturier of the Couturiers” by Gabrielle Chanel. The ultra-modern shapes were trademarks
of the house.
While the brand’s identity is firmly rooted in its highly conceptual prêt-à-porter collections, its leather goods, footwear, and accessories experience worldwide success as well. Among the archetypal
products of the House are its handbag collections. A new focus on the development of Balenciaga ready-to-wear collections for men was quickly established as highly successful.
Since October 2015, Demna Gvasalia has designed both men’s and women’s collections as the artistic director.

After making strenuous efforts to fulfil government stipulations, a lease was secured, and construction commenced in phases until the final completion in the early 1990s.

It was the unfailing support and hard work of committees, members, management and staff that enabled us to overcome all the challenges and become the thriving institution that we are today.

About Recruitment/ Headhunting career
1) What is a Recruitment Consultant and what do we do?
Recruitment is not an HR function, its more like a business development function. Recruitment consultants have a multi-faceted role. They work as marketers, networkers, problem solvers, interviewers and negotiators as they strive to find the perfect match between job seeker and employer. There's no telling where the perfect candidate may be hiding - it's the recruiter's job to find them, get them engaged, and assess their suitability for the role. Once a match has been made, consultants advise both candidates and hiring managers on issues such as salary, training, benefits and other practicalities.
While recruitment is a business development role – recruiters are expected to be target driven and excel in sales – in the end it is a people business and recruiters aim to build relationships with professionals in the market. This involves gaining trust which takes time and dedication.
2) How much can a recruitment consultant earn?
As a recruitment consultant, you have a basic salary and an upside of earning a massive annual income. Some of our consultants can earn over HKD1.5M annually or even more.

You will grow fast and strong
Recruitment is a skill. Unlike other recruitment firms, We highly emphasize the importance of training, coaching, and sharing expertise. As a beginner, you will be completely equipped to be a professional recruitment expert. You will learn advanced pitch techniques, effective communication, powerful negotiation and active listening skills in a very short timeframe, which may take you at least 3-4 years or you never have a chance to learn in other companies.
We offer a platform to transform a zero into a hero
Our number one top biller in 2020 and 2021 joined us as a summer intern and worked with us following her graduation. Her massive income has enabled her to purchase her first property and achieve other personal goals.

We Work Hard but we play harder
Unlike other recruiting firms, we have offered an environment like the GOOGLE office. We understand the importance of an enjoyable workplace. During lunch breaks, you can see us playing board games and table tennis. You may also see us playing mahjong, video games, or singing karaoke after work and during weekends. Senior consultants are allowed to bring their pets to the office; a cute puppy named ""Mimi"" is one of our family members. We also provide sleeping tents and massage armchairs to consultants to refresh their bodies and minds.
5) Who are we looking for?
