The founder of Boaz International Education Institute, Ms. Twiggy Chan, suffers from dyslexia, in which her own experience makes her understand the hardships for the students and parents in the learning journey of learning with Special Education Needs (SEN).

  Since Boaz was established, Boaz has collaborated with more than 100 schools and institutions, bringing hope to more than 800 students and families. Over 95% of the students were able to use the spelling strategy during their first session in Boaz, where they succeeded in spelling a new and complicated English word; in six months, they could successfully write a paragraph.

The programme provides the theoretical foundations and applied contexts for understanding and addressing linguistic and social questions of language and communication.

In 1937, he established the brand in Paris, designing its collections
there until 1968. Cristóbal Balenciaga had a reputation as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as ""the master of us all"" by Christian Dior and as “The Couturier of the Couturiers” by Gabrielle Chanel. The ultra-modern shapes were trademarks
of the house.
While the brand’s identity is firmly rooted in its highly conceptual prêt-à-porter collections, its leather goods, footwear, and accessories experience worldwide success as well. Among the archetypal
products of the House are its handbag collections. A new focus on the development of Balenciaga ready-to-wear collections for men was quickly established as highly successful.
Since October 2015, Demna Gvasalia has designed both men’s and women’s collections as the artistic director.
The Balenciaga House, part of the Kering group since 2001, is one of the most influential names in fashion.","Please address your application to : Camille Ng, Human Resources Officer",,camille.ng@balenciaga.com,,,,,Consumer Goods / Retail,"Accounting / Auditing / Tax

After making strenuous efforts to fulfil government stipulations, a lease was secured, and construction commenced in phases until the final completion in the early 1990s.

About Recruitment/ Headhunting career
1) What is a Recruitment Consultant and what do we do?
Recruitment is not an HR function, its more like a business development function. Recruitment consultants have a multi-faceted role. They work as marketers, networkers, problem solvers, interviewers and negotiators as they strive to find the perfect match between job seeker and employer. There's no telling where the perfect candidate may be hiding - it's the recruiter's job to find them, get them engaged, and assess their suitability for the role. Once a match has been made, consultants advise both candidates and hiring managers on issues such as salary, training, benefits and other practicalities.
While recruitment is a business development role – recruiters are expected to be target driven and excel in sales – in the end it is a people business and recruiters aim to build relationships with professionals in the market. This involves gaining trust which takes time and dedication.
2) How much can a recruitment consultant earn?
As a recruitment consultant, you have a basic salary and an upside of earning a massive annual income. Some of our consultants can earn over HKD1.5M annually or even more.
