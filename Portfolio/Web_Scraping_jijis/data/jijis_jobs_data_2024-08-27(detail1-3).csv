  創辦至今，博雅思已經與超過100間學校和機構合作，為超過800名學生與家庭帶來希望。超過95%的學生在初次會面時，能運用博雅思的學習技巧，第一次成功串出人生中第一個比較複雜的英語生字，還能在6個月內成功寫到一個段落。博雅思得到各界的肯定，並曾經獲頒「星展銀行社企業發展基金得獎者」、「匯豐青年創業大獎」金獎、「十大中小企業優質顧客服務大獎」、城市青年商會頒發之「創意創業大賞」及「We like HK 最具企業責任獎」等。

The founder of Boaz International Education Institute, Ms. Twiggy Chan, suffers from dyslexia, in which her own experience makes her understand the hardships for the students and parents in the learning journey of learning with Special Education Needs (SEN).

Under the BA curriculum we offer major and minor programmes in English Studies and Language and Communication. English Studies is the scholarly investigation of the English language and its many uses in social and historical contexts. It prominently includes the study of literature(s) written in English as well as creative writing. Both the language and the literatures are studied from multiple perspectives, linguistic ones and literary ones, and also including critical and cultural theory. Our English Studies programme has a strong cross-cultural orientation, recognizing English as a language of global communication and world literature, a language which people make their own, creatively and habitually, all over the world.  Language and Communication is an interdisciplinary programme that centres on the study of the use of language in society in a multilingual, globalized world, with a particular focus on languages of global import, such as English, as well as those with local significance, and how they are appropriated and positioned in the multilingual, cosmopolitan contexts of Asia. The programme provides the theoretical foundations and applied contexts for understanding and addressing linguistic and social questions of language and communication.
The School also contributes to the teaching of the BA&BEd in Language Education (English) and the BA&LLB double degree programmes.
Our teaching staff is broadly international and currently comprises eighteen academics who work in different areas of English literary studies and linguistics.
Our courses are designed to be interesting, challenging, and rigorous. Our emphasis is on critical and independent thinking, and we hope to prepare students to face a technologically advanced, globally competitive, and culturally open society. We incorporate a variety of teaching and learning methods, including formal lectures, seminars, small group tutorials, workshops, and online learning.
We provide supervision for research postgraduate degrees (M.Phil. and Ph.D.) and also offer two taught postgraduate programmes, a Master of Arts in English Studies and a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing in English.","Please address your application to : Professor Olga Zayts, Director of HKU Research and Impact Initiative on Communication in Healthcare","School of English, Room 735, 7/F, Run Run Shaw Tower, Centennial Campus, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong",anguscsm@hku.hk,,,https://jobs.hku.hk/cw/en/job/528647/research-assistant-iii-several-posts-in-the-school-of-english,"How to Apply

Established in Sha Tau Kok, ASTKCE gathers the public with enthusiasm and interest in cultural and historical sites, as well as natural ecology, to promote the concepts of cultural inheritance, nature conservation and community care. Through interviews, research, academic exchanges and sharing, lectures, workshops, study tours, community services, ecological and cultural education activities, etc., ASTKCE commits to conserving Hong Kong's natural environment, cultural customs and historical buildings with local characteristics. Also serving the public1 and building a happy community are also its goals.
The area of Sha Tau Kok is very large with most of the land located in the countryside. In the past, mainly Hakka people and fishermen lived there. Since the 1970s, the villagers have started moving to urban areas or foreign countries to live. It led to the abandonment of some remote villages which were being hidden in the hills and forests. ASTKCE aims to unite people with lofty ideals living inside and outside Sha Tau Kok to inherit the traditional culture of Hakkas and fishermen in Sha Tau Kok through rural tourism and artistic revitalization. By incorporating innovative ideas and artistic elements into the abandoned villages and ageing communities, the countryside can be revitalized and become a good place for outings and study.
ASTKCE has become a charitable institution which is exempt from tax under section 88 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance since 17 April 2023.

there until 1968. Cristóbal Balenciaga had a reputation as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as ""the master of us all"" by Christian Dior and as “The Couturier of the Couturiers” by Gabrielle Chanel. The ultra-modern shapes were trademarks
of the house.
While the brand’s identity is firmly rooted in its highly conceptual prêt-à-porter collections, its leather goods, footwear, and accessories experience worldwide success as well. Among the archetypal
products of the House are its handbag collections. A new focus on the development of Balenciaga ready-to-wear collections for men was quickly established as highly successful.
Since October 2015, Demna Gvasalia has designed both men’s and women’s collections as the artistic director.
