Money Forward is one of the fastest-growing Fintech companies in Japan. Since its establishment, we have launched more than 55 products in order to achieve our company's Mission, ""Money Forward. Move your life forward.""
To continue maintaining our high overall growth rate, we are expanding our market internationally with the ultimate aim of becoming a ""Global Tech Giant.""
As a start-up, Money Forward values fair opportunities for everyone to take on new challenges, regardless of age, nationality, or educational background. Because of the expansion of our business field overseas, we are currently prompting the Englishnization of the engineering organization by the end of November 2024 to attract many talented engineers both domestically and internationally. To guarantee fair opportunities for all non-Japanese natives, we do not require Japanese proficiency, not only in the screening process but also after joining.
These efforts towards Englishnization resulted in the entire organization becoming more diverse, with employees from more than 30 different countries now working in the company including those from Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America.
To ensure that employees working in Japan for the first time can fully engage in their work, we have prepared comprehensive relocation packages that include flight ticket, visa sponsorship, airport pick-up, temporary accommodation, and more.
Money Forward Culture
Our company's Vision is ""Becoming the financial platform for all.""
""Money"" may be nothing more than a tool for living. However, it is also essential for guarding ourselves and our families, as well as for realizing our dreams.
We contribute to building a better society by providing services that enable users to ""see money in a positive light and broaden their range of opportunities,"" thereby significantly enriching their lives.

Yum China became an independent publicly traded company on November 1, 2016, on the NYSE. The Company was secondary-listed on the HKEX on September 10, 2020. On October 24, 2022, the Company became dual primary listed on both the HKEX and the NYSE.

Employees are the backbone of our business, and our experienced management team continues to foster a culture based on energy, opportunity, and fun.
We build strong consumer loyalty by developing menus that cater to local tastes, in addition to offering global favorites like KFC's Original Recipe chicken.

  創辦至今，博雅思已經與超過100間學校和機構合作，為超過800名學生與家庭帶來希望。超過95%的學生在初次會面時，能運用博雅思的學習技巧，第一次成功串出人生中第一個比較複雜的英語生字，還能在6個月內成功寫到一個段落。博雅思得到各界的肯定，並曾經獲頒「星展銀行社企業發展基金得獎者」、「匯豐青年創業大獎」金獎、「十大中小企業優質顧客服務大獎」、城市青年商會頒發之「創意創業大賞」及「We like HK 最具企業責任獎」等。

The founder of Boaz International Education Institute, Ms. Twiggy Chan, suffers from dyslexia, in which her own experience makes her understand the hardships for the students and parents in the learning journey of learning with Special Education Needs (SEN). In 2013, she founded Boaz International Education Institute specialize in serving students with SEN.
  Boaz believes that ""If the children do not learn the way we teach, we teach the way they learn"".  Boaz is committed to make use of students' strengths, such as visionary and kinaesthetic skills, to provide students with a set of appropriate learning strategies, so that they can become independent learners.
  Since Boaz was established, Boaz has collaborated with more than 100 schools and institutions, bringing hope to more than 800 students and families. Over 95% of the students were able to use the spelling strategy during their first session in Boaz, where they succeeded in spelling a new and complicated English word; in six months, they could successfully write a paragraph. Boaz is now well-recognized and has received numerous awards, including the ""DBS Corporate Development Fund Winner"", ""HSBC Youth Entrepreneurship Award"" Gold Award, ""Top Ten SMEs Excellent Customer Service Award"", ""Creative Entrepreneurship Award"" issued by the City Youth Chamber of Commerce ” and ""We like HK Best Corporate Responsibility Award"" etc.

Both the language and the literatures are studied from multiple perspectives, linguistic ones and literary ones, and also including critical and cultural theory. Our English Studies programme has a strong cross-cultural orientation, recognizing English as a language of global communication and world literature, a language which people make their own, creatively and habitually, all over the world.  Language and Communication is an interdisciplinary programme that centres on the study of the use of language in society in a multilingual, globalized world, with a particular focus on languages of global import, such as English, as well as those with local significance, and how they are appropriated and positioned in the multilingual, cosmopolitan contexts of Asia. The programme provides the theoretical foundations and applied contexts for understanding and addressing linguistic and social questions of language and communication.
The School also contributes to the teaching of the BA&BEd in Language Education (English) and the BA&LLB double degree programmes.
Our teaching staff is broadly international and currently comprises eighteen academics who work in different areas of English literary studies and linguistics.
Our courses are designed to be interesting, challenging, and rigorous. Our emphasis is on critical and independent thinking, and we hope to prepare students to face a technologically advanced, globally competitive, and culturally open society. We incorporate a variety of teaching and learning methods, including formal lectures, seminars, small group tutorials, workshops, and online learning.
We provide supervision for research postgraduate degrees (M.Phil. and Ph.D.) and also offer two taught postgraduate programmes, a Master of Arts in English Studies and a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing in English.","Please address your application to : Professor Olga Zayts, Director of HKU Research and Impact Initiative on Communication in Healthcare","School of English, Room 735, 7/F, Run Run Shaw Tower, Centennial Campus, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong",anguscsm@hku.hk,,,https://jobs.hku.hk/cw/en/job/528647/research-assistant-iii-several-posts-in-the-school-of-english,"How to Apply

Finally the Club was incorporated as a non-profit making organisation in 1977. After making strenuous efforts to fulfil government stipulations, a lease was secured, and construction commenced in phases until the final completion in the early 1990s.
It has been a long and arduous process transforming that barren and hilly site into today's magnificent resort. Sometimes, the course of the Club's early development was as rocky as the magnificent scenery that surrounds us.
It was the unfailing support and hard work of committees, members, management and staff that enabled us to overcome all the challenges and become the thriving institution that we are today.

About Recruitment/ Headhunting career
1) What is a Recruitment Consultant and what do we do?
Recruitment is not an HR function, its more like a business development function. Recruitment consultants have a multi-faceted role. They work as marketers, networkers, problem solvers, interviewers and negotiators as they strive to find the perfect match between job seeker and employer. There's no telling where the perfect candidate may be hiding - it's the recruiter's job to find them, get them engaged, and assess their suitability for the role. Once a match has been made, consultants advise both candidates and hiring managers on issues such as salary, training, benefits and other practicalities.
While recruitment is a business development role – recruiters are expected to be target driven and excel in sales – in the end it is a people business and recruiters aim to build relationships with professionals in the market. This involves gaining trust which takes time and dedication.
2) How much can a recruitment consultant earn?
As a recruitment consultant, you have a basic salary and an upside of earning a massive annual income. Some of our consultants can earn over HKD1.5M annually or even more.
